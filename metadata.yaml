description: When the gentle woodcarver Geppetto builds a marionette to be his substitute
  son, a benevolent fairy brings the toy to life. The puppet, named Pinocchio is not
  yet a human boy. He must earn the right to be real by proving that he is brave,
  truthful, and unselfish. But, even with the help of Jiminy, a cricket who the fairy
  assigns to be Pinocchio's conscience, the marionette goes astray. He joins a puppet
  show instead of going to school, he lies instead of telling the truth, and he travels
  to Pleasure Island instead of going straight home. Yet, when Pinocchio discovers
  that a whale.
